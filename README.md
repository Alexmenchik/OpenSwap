## How to run

#### `npm start`

When testing, it is preferable to have the TON Wallet extension in your browser. However, if you haven't, you will get a fake wallet with fake balances.

**Live Demo: _will be added later_**

*Please note that the contest entry is in commit [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/1vanov/OpenSwap/commit/e8f922f0d4c80e1bb8db402a4bcdb5f144becd04)*
*Further development until the end of the contest will be in a separate branch.*

## Advantages

* Integration with the [TON Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd) extension for Google Chrome (this wallet doesn't support tokens yet but anyway)
* Exchange any tokens with each other *(you can check existing pools in tokens.ts)*
* A fully functioning calculations of token prices and price impacts, based on the pool reserves *(you can check existing pools in pairs.ts)*
* Add liquidity to any existing token pair or create your own
* Simple, fast and modern design

## TODO

Since I'm going to continue to develop this project and join the TON ecosystem, there's still a lot of things to do.
