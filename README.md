## How to run

#### `npm install && npm start`

It's preferable to have the [TON Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd) extension in your browser when testing. However, if you haven't, you will get a fake wallet with fake balances.

**Contest version: https://openswap.vercel.app**

**Latest dev. version: https://openswap-git-dev-1vanov.vercel.app**

*Ongoing development until the results of the contest is carried out in a separate branch.*

## Advantages

* Integration with the [TON Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd) extension for Google Chrome (this wallet doesn't support tokens yet but anyway)
* Exchange any tokens with each other *(you can check existing pools in tokens.ts)*
* A fully functioning calculations of token prices and price impacts, based on the pool reserves *(you can check existing pools in pairs.ts)*
* Add liquidity to any existing token pair or create your own
* Simple, fast and modern design

## TODO

Since I'm going to continue to develop this project and join the TON ecosystem, there's still a lot of things to do.
